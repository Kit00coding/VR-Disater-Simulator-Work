# VR-Disater-Simulator-Work
This contains my work on a VR disater simulator aimed at older adults.
This virtual reality game is constructed to recreate distsers for indicuals to work through.
The realisms for the game is very low and called for very simplistic design to not overwhelm the audience.
I was tasked with creating 3D models through Blender for the background enviorment.
This repository contains those files.
This project is an ongoing one so the repository remains open with possible updates in the future.
